# VBA_Homework

This repo holds a .bas file and three images.
The .bas file is my submission of a stock tracker macro that analyzes all sheets in a given workbook and tracks annual changes, percentage change over the year from the beginning of the year, and the total volume of stock traded throughout the year.

The images are my results from 2018, 2019, and 2020 respectively.
